				Thunder Lee is a company started by brothers and co-founders Isaiah Kacyvenski and 
				Daniel Joseph Kacyvenski as an aesthetic alternative to an over saturated market.  
				Incorporating both a lo-fi D.I.Y. look along with high end leanings, their aim is to 
				bridge the inclusive with the exclusive.  As a work-in-progress and a design experiment, 
				the company hopes to change and develop along with all of its interests and inside jokes. 
				Thunder Lee is an extension of the brothers wide-ranging paths and artistic pursuits.
